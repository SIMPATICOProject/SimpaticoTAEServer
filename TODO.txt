Changes to request format:
	- Add user ID to simplification request (no ID still produces simplification)
	- Add a re-train command

Changes to the simplification process:
	- With ID, get simplifications judged good and bad (complex word/phrase, sentence, simplification)
	- With ID, get profile (native language, age, etc), transform in one-hot vectors
	- Using profile features and bad simplifications, produce candidates
	- Create list of simplifications to send to IFE: all successful simplifications, then the best 5 generated candidates
	
Retrain process:
	- Get all data from Common20LS
	- Get all good and bad simplifications from UPM
	- For each pair of good and bad simplifications for a given word, create a binary instance from UPM
	- Retrain ridge regressor
