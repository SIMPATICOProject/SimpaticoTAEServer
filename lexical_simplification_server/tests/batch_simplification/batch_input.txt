The revised versions of legislation held on this site are maintained by the legislation editorial team at The National Archives and the staff of the Northern Ireland Statutory Publications Office – part of the Office of the Legislative Counsel in Northern Ireland within the Office of the First Minister and Deputy First Minister.
The Office of the Queen's Printer for Scotland (OQPS) provides access to Acts of the Scottish Parliament, Scottish statutory instruments and a range of other legislation applying to Scotland.
It also delivers a range of services to the public, information industry and government relating to the re-use of information created by the Scottish Government, the devolved government for Scotland.
